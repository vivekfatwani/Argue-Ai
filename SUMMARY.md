- **Moved** the Gemini API key from `main.dart` to `lib/core/config/api_keys.dart`
- **Added** the API keys file to `.gitignore` (won't be committed to Git)
- **Created** a template file for team members

### 2. ✅ Created Documentation
I created 3 helpful documents:

1. **`QUICK_START.md`** - Fast 5-minute setup guide
2. **`FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Complete detailed guide
3. **`FIREBASE_CHECKLIST.md`** - Step-by-step checklist

## 🎯 Your Authentication Flow

### Signup Flow:
```
User fills form → UserProvider.signup() → Firebase Auth creates user
→ Save to Firestore → Save locally → Navigate to Dashboard
```

### Login Flow:
```
User enters credentials → UserProvider.login() → Firebase Auth verifies
→ Get user data from Firestore → Save locally → Navigate to Dashboard
```

### Auto-Login Flow:
```
App starts → Check Firebase Auth → If logged in, get Firestore data
→ Navigate to appropriate screen
```

---

## 📊 Your Firestore Data Structure

When a user signs up, your app creates:

```javascript
users/{userId} {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  lastActive: Timestamp,
  points: 0,
  skills: {},
  completedResources: [],
  preferences: {
    darkMode: false,
    notificationsEnabled: true,
    voiceSpeed: 1.0,
    voicePitch: 1.0
  }
}
```

Plus two subcollections:
- `users/{userId}/debates` - User's debate history
- `users/{userId}/resources` - Completed learning resources

## 🔐 Important Security Actions

### ⚠️ URGENT: Your API Key Was Exposed!

The Gemini API key was hardcoded in `main.dart` and visible in your screenshots. 

**Do this NOW:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
3. **Delete/Revoke** this key: `AIzaSyC2BIc0pU7zxUCplaA1q6LYwJwtrV2AlYE`
4. **Create a new API key**
5. Update `lib/core/config/api_keys.dart` with the new key

**Good news:** The key is now in a secure config file that's ignored by Git!
